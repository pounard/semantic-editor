  <h1>Semantic editor</h1>

  <div id="my-editor">
    <h1>What you see is NOT what you get...</h1>

    <h2>... it's all about structure and semantics</h2>

    <p>
      Every people need a good text for the web, but no semantic editor really exist
      so we are going to try to fix this, someway.
    </p>

    <h2>Some content</h2>

    <h3>A simple paragraph</h3>

    <p>
      Let's start with some foo content, good theming, and we'll see what happen after
      that.
    </p>

    <p>
      And yet it has <em>paragraphs</em> in which you may have
      <a href="#top">links, <strong>big links</strong></a>, that points to somewhere.
    </p>

    <h3>A blockquote</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        There is no better than adversity. Every defeat, every heartbreak, every loss, contains its own seed,
        its own lesson on how to improve your performance the next time.
      </p>

    <h1>Todo-list</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>provide transformation tool: from p to ul, from ul to ol, from ul to set of p, etc...</li>
      <li>when hitting delete key on last offset, parent item content should be moved to this item content</li>
      <li>when hitting backspace key on first offset, current text should be moved to parent element</li>
      <li>when hitting enter key in the middle, current text after should be split and moved to a new next element</li>
      <li><del>enter key in h* should switch to a p under,</del></li>
      <li><del>enter key in p should create a new p under,</del></li>
      <li><del>enter key in li should create a new li under,</del></li>
      <li><del>enter key in dd should create a dt under,</del></li>
      <li><del>enter key in dt should create a dd under,</del></li>
      <li>inline element should be underlined only, border have weird side effects,</li>
      <li><del>blockquote should behave like an editor by itself</del>,</li>
      <li>on hover and left click, popup with allowed nested element should be created,</li>
      <li>when typing or clicking on a non editable element, popup should go away,</li>
      <li><del>set a column, on side, which displays pictograms of what's aside,</del> <em>fixed by theming</em></li>
      <li>prevent focusing out the editor (optional, accessibility),</li>
      <li>title text (accessiblity) should tell what enters does in element,</li>
      <li><del>what is possible to do should be a in ruleset, somehow,</del></li>
      <li><del>make it pluggable (medias, embed code, iframes),</del> <em>already partially is, more to come</em></li>
      <li>when selection, provide a bubble/popup that gives possible insertions/alterations,</li>
      <li>whichever happens, editor should always enforce typographic rules (no manual line feed, no empty paragraph).</li>
